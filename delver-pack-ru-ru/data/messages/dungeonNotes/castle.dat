			"Matz, things further inside the ruins seem to be intact - it's just as we hoped! The location is off from where the old maps said that the mage king's tower would,",

			"В этих руинах веками никто не бывал, какая находка! Горы, окружающие башню, отпугивали людей. У королевства вероятно  были порталы, чтобы добраться сюда быстрее, чем вышло у нас."

			"I don't care what that so called scholar Matz says, something is alive down here and I don't mean those insufferable bats.",
