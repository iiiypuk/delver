			"Matz, things further inside the ruins seem to be intact - it's just as we hoped! The location is off from where the old maps said that the mage king's tower would,",
			"and only the lower floors and basements are left intact, but all of the things we're finding indicate that this is indeed the place."
		],
		[
			"Send back word to the Heralds, those scholars actually found the place. We'll sneak down ahead of the main group, if this tower is here that means one of the artifacts is likely here as well."
		],
		[
			"Nobody has been in these ruins for centuries, what a find! The mountains ringing the tower have kept people away, the kingdom probably had portals to get here easier than we did."

			"Send some men back up to move the expedition supplies, they'll be safer in here than sitting outside in the rain."

			"We've found some intact libraries but the intact books are written in something that looks like Oldhand, translation will be slow going."

			"Exploring the ruins has been slow going as of yet, I fear we're pushing the men too hard. Some have already left us, probably to head back home.",

		[
			"I don't care what that so called scholar Matz says, something is alive down here and I don't mean those insufferable bats.",
			"Last night I heard scraping at the door of the barracks we had set up in, but whatever it was cleared out as soon as I set out after it."

		[
			"Start lighting the torches as we go, exploring will be easier if we can see without these lanterns and we can keep track of where we've been."

			"Stay away! This place is a nightmare, we should have never come. The things we're stirring up here should have stayed buried forever.",
